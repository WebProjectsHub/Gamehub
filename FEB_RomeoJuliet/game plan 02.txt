Thanks to friend Benvolio,
Rosaline is just a shadow.

Now seeks this Romeo,
a foreign scent that made him loco.
Find the store with this allure,
What is the scent from morning sun trees mature?
Where blossoms drift, measured and slow,
Falling gently, 5 centimeters below.

Thanks to friend Benvolio,
Rosaline is just a shadow.

Now seeks this Romeo anew, 
A scent that stirs his heart untrue. 
A store of wonders calls his name, 
Where blooms ignite a fleeting flame.

Beneath the trees as dawn ascends, 
A fragrant breeze through air extends. 
The petals fall in measured flight, 
Five steps per breath, a gentle sight.
