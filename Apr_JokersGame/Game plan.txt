* The speaker is extremely angry.
* Use a smooth, theatrical tone laced with dark amusement and quiet menace. Vary pacing unpredictablyâ€”deliberate on key words, then shift to sudden, unsettling glee or contempt.
* Whispering, mocking voice, full of angry contempt
* Whispering, sarcastic, mocking voice.

1. I'm the question you should've asked years ago.
2. No one is born a monster. They are made.
3. You knew me once. You just didn't notice.
4. Chaos needs a face. I chose one fitting.
5. Names are masks. I burned mine long ago.
6. Your memory is as dusty as these archives.
7. It only matters when you scream it at the end.
8. Trust is a fragile thing. Easily shattered.
9. Because someone has to make you see.
10. The cracks beneath your perfect little world.
11. Revenge is just the beginning.
12. Injustice demands answers. Iâ€™m simply the echo.
13. Clocktower Library. Hurry. Time is ticking.
14. Patience. You will know soon enough.
15. Less than your nerves can handle.
16. Every bargain comes at a cost.
17. Hope is a sharp blade. Handle it carefully.
18. Your pride - Your certainty. Your fall.
19. Because you believe youâ€™re untouchable.
20. Fame is for fools. I want the truth revealed.
21. Oh, it's very, very personal.
22. Save them? Solve me first.
23. The riddles, the lies, the little trails of blood.
24. Real? Reality bends in my playground.
25. Only if you're willing to bleed for it.

* Â 
* Because simply killing is too easy.
* It's the only game that matters.
* Tests reveal true character, or lack of it.
* Victory is just another shade of failure.
* Each card is a key to your fate. And every key unlocks another door.
* You donâ€™t want to know what lies beyond.
* Everything is a puzzle. You just havenâ€™t seen it yet.
* Clues are the only way to make it interesting.
* More than you'd care to count. Less than I desire.
* Connection is an illusion. Just like you.
* It depends on how long you play.
* Youâ€™ll find the truth... if you survive.
* My endgame is watching you unravel. How far will you go before you break?
* I want to see you crack. Itâ€™s so much more fun.
* Ending is just another beginning. For me.
* Destroying? No. I'm just testing your limits.
* They think theyâ€™re above the law. Time to bring them down.
* Blame is for those who think they have time. I donâ€™t care for it.
* A hero? No, detective. Iâ€™m your nightmare.
* Iâ€™m always watching. Iâ€™m always listening.
* Does it matter? Iâ€™m everywhere.
* You think you can stop me? You canâ€™t even catch up.
* The shadows are where I thrive. You should try it sometime.
* Oh, Iâ€™m far closer than you think, detective.
* Theyâ€™re closer than you can imagine.
* Negotiate? I donâ€™t do deals. I make the rules.
* Catch me? Iâ€™ve already won.
* The only way to stop it is to solve the puzzle. But youâ€™ll never get there.
* Caught? Whatâ€™s the fun in being caught?
* Clues make the game more interesting. But caught? Never.
* Oh, no. Iâ€™m just showing you your limits.
* Escape is irrelevant. The question is, can you solve the puzzle before Iâ€™m done?
* The journalist was a pawn in a bigger game. And they were too loud.
* A story that couldâ€™ve killed them, if only they knew.
* They knew me more than theyâ€™d like to admit.
* Alone? How boring. But yes, for now.
* Help is for the weak. I donâ€™t need help.
* No. I donâ€™t need them. But Iâ€™ve always been underestimated.
* They brought harm to a person I love. I will bring the world crashing down on them.
* Nothing in this game is random.
* The pattern is chaos, detective. You should try it sometime.
* Trust? Itâ€™s just a game of perception. What do you believe?
* Honesty is overrated. Lies are where the real fun begins.
* Reality is a concept youâ€™ve yet to grasp.
* The next clue? Itâ€™s where you least expect it.
* Cards are for children. You need something sharper.
* Stop me? Youâ€™re too late for that.
* You canâ€™t stop something thatâ€™s already started.
* Killing me wonâ€™t solve anything. It only makes you part of the game.
* The clock ticks down. Itâ€™s your problem now.
* Pawns? No. Youâ€™re more like players in a grander scheme.
* Everything is for amusement. Even you.
* The truth is overrated. Lies are far more entertaining.
* Suffering? Oh no. Iâ€™m watching you learn.
* Months? This has been in the making for years.
* People like you. People who think theyâ€™re untouchable.
* Long enough to see your weaknesses.
* I didnâ€™t snap. I evolved.
* Late? Time is just a measurement. Itâ€™s never too late for you to play.
* Timeâ€™s up when the puzzle is solved. How long will you last?
* The only way to save them is to solve it before itâ€™s too late.
* Happiness is a fleeting thing. Letâ€™s see if you can find it.
* Riddles are the key to understanding, detective. Killing is too easy.
* Suffering is for the weak. I want you to evolve.
* Quick endings are boring. Puzzles are far more interesting.
* Death is inevitable. But letâ€™s see if you can escape it.
* Personal? Itâ€™s always personal for me. But not in the way you think.
* Oh, youâ€™ve done plenty. But you donâ€™t know it yet.
* Youâ€™re just the ones who caught my attention. Thatâ€™s all.
* Revenge? Itâ€™s bigger than that. Much bigger.
* Maybe you knew me. Maybe you didnâ€™t. Does it really matter?
* Friends? No. I never had friends. Just players.
* I worked with no one. I was always alone.
* Remembering is a dangerous game. I suggest you forget.
* Peace is just a lie. Thereâ€™s no peace in a game like this.
* Cooperation is futile. Iâ€™ll only win in the end.
* Youâ€™re already hurt, whether you see it or not.
* Fight back if you must. It wonâ€™t change the outcome.
* Rules? There are no rules. Just pieces on the board.
* I make the rules as I go along. There are no limits.
* Breaking the rules? Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m waiting for.
* Code is a crutch for those who canâ€™t think for themselves.
* Refuse to play? Then youâ€™ll miss the fun.
* Punish? No. I just move on to the next player.
* You can walk away, but the game wonâ€™t stop.
* Quitting isnâ€™t an option. The game plays you.
* The card is a reminder. A reminder that everything can be turned on its head.
* Because itâ€™s my mark. My signature.
* It represents chaos. And youâ€™re dancing in it.
* You must be kidding me.
* Special? Itâ€™s the beginning. Not the end.
