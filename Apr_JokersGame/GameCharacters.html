					The Steadfast Leader
				</h4>
				<h2>
					Captain Marcus Holloway
				</h2>
				<h4>
					Background
				</h4>
				<p>
Captain Marcus Holloway is a seasoned veteran of the force, known for his calm demeanor, sharp instincts, and no-nonsense approach to leadership. With over 25 years of experience, he has seen it all—cold-blooded killers, corrupt officials, and cases that have haunted him for years. He believes in justice above all else but has learned the hard way that the system doesn’t always work in his favor.
	<br><br>
Once a brilliant homicide detective, Holloway worked some of the most brutal cases in the city’s history. He became captain after solving a high-profile serial killer case, but the victory came at a personal cost—his partner was killed in the final confrontation. That loss hardened him, making him both a mentor and a strict taskmaster.
	<br><br>
				</p>
				<h4>
					Personality & Leadership Style
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Strategic & Calculated: Always looks at the big picture, ensuring that his detectives stay focused.
	</li>
	<li>
Respected, but Intimidating: He doesn’t tolerate recklessness but admires genuine talent.
	</li>
	<li>
Protective: Though he pushes his team hard, he sees them as his responsibility.
	</li>
	<li>
Skeptical of Technology: Prefers old-school detective work, often butting heads with Samantha Vaughn.
	</li>
	<li>
Trust Issues: Losing his partner left scars—he struggles to fully trust his team
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					Relationship with the Detectives
				</h4>
				<p>
Evie Carter (Senior Detective): He trusts her judgment but pushes her to be more methodical.
	<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
"Your instincts are good, Carter. Just don’t let them get you killed."
	<br>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
Samantha Vaughn (Rookie, Ex-Hacker): Disapproves of her unconventional methods, but secretly admires her resourcefulness.
	<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
"This isn’t a damn video game, Vaughn. Every move you make has consequences."
	<br>
		</blockquote>
		<p>
Rachel Morales (Rookie, Forensic Expert): Respects her scientific mind but believes forensics alone won’t solve cases.
	<br>
		</p>
		<blockquote>
"The evidence speaks, Morales. But make sure you’re asking the right questions."
	<br>
		</blockquote>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					How He Feels About the Joker Killer Case
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Frustrated that they are playing by the killer’s rules.
	</li>
	<li>
Worried that the younger detectives are being pulled too deep into the mind games.
	</li>
	<li>
Determined to end the killing spree, no matter what it takes.
	</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
Despite his hardened exterior, Captain Holloway cares deeply for his team and will do whatever it takes to keep them alive—even if it means breaking a few rules.

					The Relentless Investigator
				</h4>
				<h2>
					Lead Detective Evelyn "Evie" Carter
				</h2>
				<h4>
					Background
				</h4>
				<p>
Detective Evelyn "Evie" Carter is a seasoned investigator with over 12 years on the force. She is known for her sharp intuition, relentless work ethic, and ability to connect the dots where others see only chaos.
	<br><br>
Originally aspiring to be a criminal psychologist, Evie changed course after the tragic murder of a close friend. Fueled by a need for justice, she joined the police academy and quickly climbed the ranks, excelling in behavioral analysis, profiling, and interrogation tactics.
	<br><br>
				</p>
				<h4>
					Personality & Leadership Style
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Methodical but Intuitive: She follows the evidence but trusts her gut.
	</li>
	<li>
Deeply Empathetic: Cares deeply about victims and their families.
	</li>
	<li>
Determined to a Fault: Pushes herself beyond limits, often ignoring her own well-being.
	</li>
	<li>
Clashes with Superiors: Challenges red tape when it obstructs justice.
	</li>
	<li>
Despises Manipulative Killers: The Joker Killer's obsession with games makes this case personal.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					Relationship with the Team
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Captain Marcus Holloway: Trusts her skills but warns her about recklessness. She respects his experience.
	</li>
	<li>
Samantha Vaughn (Rookie, Ex-Hacker): Sees potential but keeps a close watch on her impulsive nature.
	</li>
	<li>
Rachel Morales (Rookie, Forensic Expert): Balances Evie’s instincts with science and data-driven analysis.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					How She Feels About the Joker Killer Case
				</h4>
				<p>
Evie has faced dangerous killers before, but this one plays by different rules. The way the Joker Killer taunts law enforcement and turns murder into a game infuriates her.
	<br><br>
For Evie, solving this case isn’t just about stopping a killer—it’s about beating him at his own game before he escalates. But deep down, there’s a fear she won’t admit:

					The Tech-Savvy Rebel
				</h4>
				<h2>
					Detective Samantha Vaughn
				</h2>
				<h4>
					Background
				</h4>
				<p>
Detective Samantha Vaughn never planned to be a cop. A self-taught coding prodigy, she became known in underground hacker circles as "ZeroTrace" before she was even out of high school. With an innate talent for breaching security systems, she saw hacking as a challenge—until she got caught.
	<br><br>
At 19, Samantha was arrested for breaking into a security firm’s database. Instead of prison, she was given a choice: work for law enforcement or face serious charges. She chose the former, consulting for cybercrime units while studying cybersecurity. Eventually, she joined the police force, determined to use her skills for something bigger than herself.
	<br><br>
				</p>
				<h4>
					Personality & Approach
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Brilliant but Reckless: She’s a genius with computers but doesn’t always think before acting.
	</li>
	<li>
Street-Smart & Resourceful: While tech is her specialty, she knows how to read people.
	</li>
	<li>
Hates Rules, Loves Results: She’ll break protocol if it means getting answers faster.
	</li>
	<li>
Cocky but Loyal: She loves proving she’s the smartest in the room but is fiercely protective of her team.
	</li>
	<li>
Still Haunted by Her Past: She wonders if her skills make her more like the criminals she chases.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					Relationship with the Team
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Evelyn "Evie" Carter (Lead Detective): Samantha respects Evie’s experience but sometimes clashes with her by taking shortcuts. Deep down, she sees Evie as a mentor.
	</li>
	<li>
Rachel Morales (Rookie, Forensic Expert): They get along, but Samantha teases Rachel for being "too by the book." Despite this, she trusts her instincts.
	</li>
	<li>
Captain Marcus Holloway: He keeps a close eye on her, wary of her past. She resents it but secretly appreciates his concern.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					How She Feels About the Joker Killer Case
				</h4>
				<p>
For Samantha, this case is a game she refuses to lose. The Joker Killer’s use of logic-based puzzles speaks her language, and she sees it as a battle of wits.
	<br><br>
But what really unsettles her is how familiar the Joker’s methods feel. Could he be someone like her—someone who just took it too far?

					The Forensic Perfectionist
				</h4>
				<h2>
					Detective Rachel Morales
				</h2>
				<h4>
					Background
				</h4>
				<p>
Rachel Morales always knew she wanted to be in law enforcement, but she never envisioned herself chasing criminals with a gun in hand. Instead, she saw herself in the lab, meticulously analyzing fibers, blood spatter, and DNA. Science was her language, and forensics was her passion.
	<br><br>
Raised in a working-class family, Rachel was the first in her family to go to college. She pursued biochemistry and forensic science, earning top honors. While interning at the police department’s forensic unit, she developed a reputation for noticing what others missed—a single hair, a microscopic tear in clothing, or an odd chemical compound. Her attention to detail led to multiple breakthroughs in cases, catching the eye of seasoned detectives.
	<br><br>
Despite preferring the lab over the streets, Rachel chose to become a detective rather than stay behind a microscope. She wanted to see investigations through from crime scene to conviction, ensuring that no mistakes were made in the pursuit of justice.
	<br><br>
				</p>
				<h4>
					Personality & Approach
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Perfectionist & Methodical – Every detail matters. If it doesn’t fit, she won’t rest until she knows why.
	</li>
	<li>
Cautious & By-the-Book – She believes in procedure and hates taking unnecessary risks.

	</li>
	<li>
Logical & Analytical – She approaches cases like a puzzle, breaking them down piece by piece.
	</li>
	<li>
Empathetic but Detached – She cares about victims but doesn’t let emotions cloud her judgment.
	</li>
	<li>
Secretly Competitive – While she pretends she doesn’t care, she hates being wrong.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					Relationship with the Team
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Evelyn "Evie" Carter (Lead Detective): Rachel sees Evie as a role model. She admires her leadership but sometimes struggles with her gut-driven approach.
	</li>
	<li>
Samantha Vaughn (Rookie, Ex-Hacker): Their differences make them clash. Samantha rushes into things, while Rachel prefers a careful analysis. However, when they work together, they make an unstoppable team.
	</li>
	<li>
Captain Marcus Holloway: She respects his experience and values his approval. She often seeks his input when doubting herself.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					How She Feels About the Joker Killer Case
				</h4>
				<p>
To Rachel, this case is a test of precision. The Joker Killer isn’t just leaving riddles—he’s leaving forensic evidence woven into the puzzles. Every fiber, every bloodstain, every number has a pattern.
	<br><br>
The challenge? Deciphering that pattern before more people die.
	<br><br>
While Samantha sees the Joker Killer as a game to win, Rachel sees him as a mistake waiting to happen. No one is perfect. Not even a killer obsessed with logic. And when he makes that mistake, she’ll be the one to find it.

					The Young, Brilliant Detective Trainee
				</h4>
				<h2>
					Detective (Trainee) Lily Park
				</h2>
				<h4>
					Background
				</h4>
				<p>
Lily Park grew up in a family that loved brain teasers, crosswords, and mystery novels. While other kids were playing sports, she was solving cryptograms and escape room challenges. Her ability to spot patterns and think outside the box made her a standout in school, where she excelled in logic and deduction.
	<br><br>
Despite her analytical mind, Lily was never seen as a "traditional cop." Many in the academy doubted her, thinking she was too young, too eager, and too much of a "book nerd" to handle real police work. But what she lacked in field experience, she made up for in raw intelligence and unconventional thinking.
	<br><br>
Her impressive test scores and quick reasoning caught the attention of higher-ups, and she was fast-tracked into detective training. Though she still has a lot to learn about working in the field, her sharp mind makes her an unexpected asset to the team.
	<br><br>
				</p>
				<h4>
					Personality & Approach
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Eager & Enthusiastic – Always ready to dive into a case, sometimes too quickly.
	</li>
	<li>
Brilliant Problem-Solver – Sees connections others might overlook.
	</li>
	<li>
Unconventional Thinker – Thinks outside the box, sometimes breaking standard procedures.
	</li>
	<li>
Still Learning the Ropes – Inexperienced with real-world crime scenes and struggles with the emotional toll of the job.
	</li>
	<li>
Energetic & Optimistic – Despite the darkness of the cases, she believes every puzzle has a solution.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					Relationship with the Team
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Evelyn "Evie" Carter (Lead Detective): Evie sees potential in Lily but is tough on her, knowing real-world detective work isn’t just about being smart—it’s about endurance.
	</li>
	<li>
Samantha Vaughn (Rookie, Ex-Hacker): They get along well, but Lily’s boundless energy sometimes clashes with Sam’s more cynical outlook.
	</li>
	<li>
Rachel Morales (Forensic Expert): Rachel respects Lily’s intellect but often reminds her that <i>"logic alone won’t solve everything—sometimes, you need evidence."</i>
	</li>
	<li>
Captain Marcus Holloway: He wasn’t sure about assigning someone so young to the team, but he’s beginning to see why she was chosen.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					How She Feels About the Joker Killer Case
				</h4>
				<p>
To Lily, this case is the ultimate puzzle—a real-life challenge unlike anything she’s ever faced. The Joker Killer’s logic-based riddles excite and terrify her in equal measure. She wants to prove herself by solving them, but as the stakes rise, she starts to wonder: Is she just another piece in his game?

					The Unknown
				</h4>
				<h2>
					The Joker
				</h2>
				<h4>
					Real Identity (Unknown to Detectives)
				</h4>
				<p>
Arthur Hayes (Revealed later, adding a layer of mystery)
	<br><br>
				</p>
				<h4>
					Background and Origin
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Arthur Hayes was a meticulous, almost obsessive, office worker. His life was structured, predictable, and devoid of genuine connection. His only outlet was his intricate puzzle creations, elaborate logic games that he crafted in his spare time. These puzzles were a desperate attempt to impose order on a chaotic world, a world that ultimately betrayed him.
	</li>
	<li>
The incident that shattered Arthur's fragile reality was the botched police raid. His wife, Eleanor, was not simply a "bystander" but the only person who saw and accepted his puzzles. He saw her as the only person that made his life meaningful.
	</li>
	<li>
The captain's friend, Detective Marcus Thorne, became the focal point of Arthur's rage. Thorne's "heroic" portrayal in the media, despite his role in Eleanor's death, twisted Arthur's perception of justice.
	</li>
	<li>
The trauma didn't just drive Arthur to madness; it warped his very sense of reality. He saw the world as a cruel, illogical game, and he became determined to play by his own rules.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					Motivation
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
The catalyst for Arthur's transformation into the Joker is the 5th anniversary of the incident, marked by a journalist's article. This article, intended to recap the infamous shootout and the city's fallen crime boss, becomes a twisted memorial for Arthur. 
	</li>
	<li>
The journalist's portrayal of Detective Marcus Thorne, the captain's friend, as a "hero" of that day, despite his role in Eleanor's death, is the spark that ignites Arthur's rage. The article's narrative, as Arthur perceives it, is a blatant distortion of the truth, a mockery of his grief.
	</li>
	<li>
Further fueling his anger is the journalist's account of Eleanor's death, which Arthur sees as a dismissive footnote in a story glorifying her killer. The journalist's interviews, including the captain's, paint Thorne as a victim, while Eleanor's life is reduced to a tragic, but ultimately insignificant, casualty.
	</li>
	<li>
During the interview for the part of the article covering the death of the bystander, the husband learns of how the journalist will portray the person who killed his wife as a hero. This drove him to the edge.
	</li>
	<li>
Fueled by a burning desire for vengeance, Arthur meticulously plans the deaths of those he deems responsible. He sees them as complicit in the injustice, their actions and words contributing to the erasure of Eleanor's memory.
	</li>
	<li>
After murdering the journalist and perusing his notebook, Arthur discovers the names and connections of his targets. It is in that moment, surrounded by the evidence of the journalist's biased narrative, that he fully embraces his new identity: The Joker. He decides to create "The Game," a twisted series of events designed to expose the "truth" and punish those who wronged him.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					Targets
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
The journalist, for his distorted narrative.
	</li>
	<li>
Eleanor's employer, for forcing her to work on that fateful day.
	</li>
	<li>
Eleanor's coworker, whose shift she covered.
	</li>
	<li>
The taxi driver, whose reckless driving contributed to the ambulance's delay.
	</li>
	<li>
The Captain, for protecting Thorne's image.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					Compulsion / Killer Profile
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
Highly intelligent and methodical.
	</li>
	<li>
Compelled to build elaborate, logic-based puzzles.
	</li>
	<li>
Leaves a calling card at each scene—usually a playing card or cryptic puzzle.
	</li>
				</ul>
	<br><br>
				<h4>
					SIgnificance of the Joker Card
				</h4>
				<ul>
	<li>
On the day of the tragic incident, Arthur was there to pick up his wife from work. He witnessed the entire chaotic scene unfold.
	</li>
	<li>
Due to the covert nature of the police operation, nearby establishments were not warned. Arthur was crossing the street, waving to his smiling wife, when the shootout erupted from a nearby building.
	</li>
	<li>
A figure in a police jacket, Detective Marcus Thorne, rushed past Arthur.
	</li>
	<li>
As the shootout intensified, Thorne shot the fleeing crime boss, but was himself shot in the neck. As he spun, his gun discharged involuntarily, fatally wounding Eleanor.
	</li>
	<li>
Arthur rushed to his wife's side. In his haste, he flung his bag aside. The bag contained playing cards, intended for his next puzzle.
	</li>
	<li>
The playing cards scattered on the street. One of them, the Joker card, landed beside the pool of blood pouring from Eleanor's wound.
	</li>
	<li>
Arthur's gaze was fixated on the Joker card as the police dragged him away. This image became a defining moment in his descent into madness.
	</li>
	<li>
The Joker card, found next to his wife's blood, became a symbol of the random, senseless violence that stole her life, and a representation of the chaotic persona he would adopt.
	</li>
				</ul>
