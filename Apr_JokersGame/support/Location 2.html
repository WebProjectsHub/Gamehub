  <h1>🎭 Location 2: Observatory Theater</h1>
  <p class="highlight">Setting: An abandoned observatory turned black-box theater—dusty, half-collapsed in places, once used for community plays and stargazing events. Moonlight filters in through a cracked glass dome overhead. Faded constellations still cling to the ceiling. The stage sits quiet… too quiet.</p>

  <div class="location-tag">[Exterior – Night – Observatory Entrance]</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="name">Evie</span>: “Why here?”</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="name">Samantha</span>: “This place has been closed for years. No power, no security system. Perfect spot to leave something… or someone.”</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="name">Lily</span>: “If I were a puzzle-maker, this is where I’d build my next act.”</div>

  <div class="location-tag">[Interior – Stage Floor – Minutes Later]</div>
  <p>Dust motes swirl in the flashlight beams as the team sweeps the building. Footsteps echo. The floorboards creak like they're whispering.</p>
  <p>On stage sits a single <strong>wooden chair</strong>, draped in <strong>red velvet</strong>. A <strong>masquerade mask</strong> hangs off the back. Above, the overhead spotlight flickers to life. No one touched it.</p>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="name">Rachel</span>: “Someone rigged this. That light doesn’t run on mains… it’s battery-powered.”</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="name">Sofia</span>: “Check this out.”</div>
  <p>A <strong>scrap of sheet music</strong> lies on the seat, marked with the words:</p>
  <blockquote>“She sings to forget. But remembers the screams.”</blockquote>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="name">Samantha</span>: “This is Carmen Vale. She used to perform here... and she was seeing Keller.”</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="name">Evie</span>: “Was she involved with the investigation?”</div>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="name">Rachel</span>: “No. Nothing on her. Maybe she didn’t even know what he was working on.”</div>

  <div class="location-tag">[Backstage – Dressing Room Mirror]</div>
  <p>A cracked makeup mirror is smeared with red lipstick, writing in reverse:</p>
  <blockquote>“Behind the false glass, her truth waits frozen.”</blockquote>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="name">Lily</span>: “Is this… literal?”</div>
  <p>Behind the mirror is a hidden cubby, containing:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>burned photograph</strong> of Carmen and Keller</li>
    <li>A small <strong>USB recorder</strong></li>
    <li>A <strong>guest list</strong> for the <em>Heights Hotel Charity Gala</em></li>
  </ul>

  <p>They play the recording. Carmen’s voice comes through, shaking:</p>
  <blockquote>“He was going to tell them everything. I told him it wasn’t safe. They said… they said if I speak, I’ll end up like him.”</blockquote>
  <p>In the background:</p>
  <blockquote>A male voice, distorted: “You’re just the echo now. No one hears an echo.”</blockquote>
  <div class="dialogue"><span class="name">Sofia</span>: “He’s silencing them. One by one.”</div>

  <div class="location-tag">Climactic Beat</div>
  <p>Suddenly, the old projector hums to life. A faint image flickers across the dome ceiling: a vintage reel showing a <strong>masked performer bowing</strong> on stage as the words appear in scrawled, flashing letters:</p>
  <blockquote><strong>ACT TWO BEGINS AT THE HEIGHTS.</strong><br><strong>THE FINAL BOW WAITS FOR THE MAN WHO LED THE PARADE.</strong></blockquote>

  <h2>🔎 Scene End – Clues Unlocked</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Carmen Vale is possibly the <strong>next victim</strong>.</li>
    <li>The Joker sees the events as a <strong>performance</strong>—and the detectives as his actors.</li>
    <li><strong>"The man who led the parade"</strong> = <em>Captain Reyes</em> (a subtle foreshadow).</li>
    <li>The next location is the <strong>Heights Hotel Gala</strong>.</li>
  </ul>
