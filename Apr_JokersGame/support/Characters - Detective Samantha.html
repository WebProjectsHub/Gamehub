    <h1>Character - Detective Samantha</h1>
    <h2>Samantha Vaughn – The Tech-Savvy Rebel</h2>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Detective <strong>Samantha Vaughn</strong> never planned to be a cop. A self-taught coding prodigy, she became known in underground hacker circles as <strong>"ZeroTrace"</strong> before she was even out of high school. With an innate talent for breaching security systems, she saw hacking as a challenge—until she got caught.</p>
    
    <p>At <strong>19</strong>, Samantha was arrested for breaking into a security firm’s database. Instead of prison, she was given a choice: <strong>work for law enforcement or face serious charges.</strong> She chose the former, consulting for cybercrime units while studying cybersecurity. Eventually, she joined the police force, determined to use her skills for something bigger than herself.</p>
    
    <h2>Personality & Approach</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Brilliant but Reckless:</strong> She’s a genius with computers but doesn’t always think before acting.</li>
        <li><strong>Street-Smart & Resourceful:</strong> While tech is her specialty, she knows how to read people.</li>
        <li><strong>Hates Rules, Loves Results:</strong> She’ll break protocol if it means getting answers faster.</li>
        <li><strong>Cocky but Loyal:</strong> She loves proving she’s the smartest in the room but is fiercely protective of her team.</li>
        <li><strong>Still Haunted by Her Past:</strong> She wonders if her skills make her more like the criminals she chases.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Relationship with the Team</h2>
    <p><strong>Evelyn "Evie" Carter (Lead Detective):</strong> Samantha respects Evie’s experience but sometimes clashes with her by taking shortcuts. Deep down, she sees Evie as a mentor.</p>
    <p><strong>Rachel Morales (Rookie, Forensic Expert):</strong> They get along, but Samantha teases Rachel for being "too by the book." Despite this, she trusts her instincts.</p>
    <p><strong>Captain Marcus Holloway:</strong> He keeps a close eye on her, wary of her past. She resents it but secretly appreciates his concern.</p>
    
    <h2>How She Feels About the Joker Killer Case</h2>
    <p>For Samantha, this case is <strong>a game she refuses to lose.</strong> The Joker Killer’s use of <strong>logic-based puzzles</strong> speaks her language, and she sees it as a <strong>battle of wits.</strong></p>
    
    <p>But what really unsettles her is how <strong>familiar</strong> the Joker’s methods feel. Could he be someone like her—someone who just <strong>took it too far?</strong></p>
    
    <p class="quote">"Catching the Joker Killer means looking in a mirror I don’t want to face."</p>
