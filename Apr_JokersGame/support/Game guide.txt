Central Precinct HQ

Real-World Counterpart:
New York City Police Department
One Police Plaza, New York, NY 10038

The Scene:
The nerve center of the investigation. Normally a place of authority and order. Today, it feels like a trap.

Itâ€™s late evening. Rain lashes against the windows of the precinct. Thunder rolls in the distance. Inside, tension hangs in the air. The station should be a sanctuaryâ€”but now, itâ€™s the Jokerâ€™s next crime scene.

The office was completely evacuated.  Police cars and firetrucks, barricades and police officers milling outside the building then the detectives arrive.  

Only Captain Marcus Holloway is left inside, sitting in his office.  The office is booby-trapped. A pressure plate beneath the Captain's chair is rigged.  If he tries to stand, it will explode. 

The detectives are now on video call with the Captain.  He explained what happened.  At the same time that the detectives start the chat with the Joker, A phone rang in tha station asking for the Captain.  A distorted voice told him to check evidence locker, in the files regarding Eleanor Hayes's death.  There, a USB that is not supposed to be there.

He brought it to his office, plugged in his laptop, a timer started and a message that if he moves, the chair, and other explosives hidden in the station will explode.  It was a bluff, except for the explosive under his chair.  It can be deactivated if you input the correct code.  Explosive experts are unable to deactivate it.

A new message appeared.  It told him to confess his cover up on the death of Eleanor Hayes.  That he should make it public and reveal who the real murderer is.

He has 1 hour to do that or the bomb will explode.
