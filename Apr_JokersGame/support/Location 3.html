  <h1>Location 3 – The Heights Hotel Gala</h1>
  <p class="scene-desc">Setting: A luxurious rooftop ballroom at The Heights Hotel. The charity gala is in full swing—music, chatter, the clinking of glasses—but beneath the glamor, danger simmers. The detectives attend in disguise, hoping to prevent a murder and uncover the Joker Killer’s next move. Carmen Vale is here—nervous, glancing over her shoulder—and someone else is watching her closely.</p>

  <h2>Scene Script</h2>
  <p class="scene-desc">Interior – Heights Hotel Rooftop Ballroom – Evening</p>

  <p>Glittering chandeliers, champagne towers, and a live quartet—everything screams perfection. But the detectives, dressed to blend in, are all tension and purpose.</p>

  <p class="dialogue">Evie (into earpiece):</p>
  <p>“Eyes on everyone. Joker’s already two steps ahead. Tonight’s not just for show.”</p>

  <p class="dialogue">Samantha (from corner bar, scanning):</p>
  <p>“I hacked into the hotel’s security cam feed. There’s a blind spot near the east balcony. Too convenient.”</p>

  <p class="dialogue">Rachel (posing as a server):</p>
  <p>“Carmen’s here. Table 9. She looks like she’s about to bolt.”</p>

  <p class="dialogue">Lily (wide-eyed, taking it all in):</p>
  <p>“If the Joker’s treating this like a stage… then someone’s about to take center.”</p>

  <p class="scene-desc">At Carmen Vale’s Table</p>

  <p>The detectives approach carefully. Carmen, in a shimmering black gown, flinches as Evie sits beside her.</p>

  <p class="dialogue">Evie (softly):</p>
  <p>“You’re safe. But you need to talk to us. About Keller. About the voice on that recording.”</p>

  <p class="dialogue">Carmen (barely whispering):</p>
  <p>“You don’t get it. He said this would happen. Said if I sang again in public… I’d be the next aria in his symphony of silence.”</p>

  <p>Before she can say more, the <strong>lights flicker</strong>.</p>
  <p>The quartet stops. Murmurs rise. Then—</p>

  <p class="dialogue">Samantha (alarmed):</p>
  <p>“Check the projection screen—main stage!”</p>

  <p>The projector whirs to life behind the curtains. A vintage film starts playing, silent and scratchy:</p>
  <blockquote>
    A marionette on strings. Dancing. Struggling.  
    Then its strings are cut.
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>“THE SPOTLIGHT’S LAST KISS COMES TONIGHT.”</strong><br>
    <strong>“PULL THE RIGHT STRING—OR SHE FALLS.”</strong>
  </blockquote>

  <p>The crowd thinks it’s performance art. Only the team knows better.</p>

  <div class="clue">
    <h3>Clue Drops Rapidly</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A <strong>ticking metronome</strong> is found under the podium, set to stop at <strong>9:13 PM</strong>.</li>
      <li>Rachel finds <strong>coded numbers etched</strong> into wineglass stems at Carmen’s table.</li>
      <li>Samantha disables a <strong>signal jamming device</strong> hidden in the DJ booth.</li>
      <li>Lily discovers a torn piece of sheet music:
        <blockquote>“C to F. F to A. Then drop the beat, and someone fades away.”</blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p class="dialogue">Evie (gritted):</p>
    <p>“This is a timed puzzle. If we don’t solve it before the metronome stops…”</p>

    <p class="dialogue">Rachel:</p>
    <p>“…Carmen won’t be the one giving an encore.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="twist">
    <h3>Twist</h3>
    <p>Carmen isn’t the target. She was the bait.</p>
    <p>The <strong>real victim</strong> is <strong>Vincent Dalca</strong>, former cop and the one who accidentally shot the Joker Killer’s wife during the original arrest.</p>

    <p>Just as 9:13 PM hits, a scream echoes from the service elevator.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">Evie (rushing to the scene):</p>
    <p>“He got to him.”</p>

    <p>Vincent Dalca is found tied to a chair backstage. Chest still. A card placed on his forehead:</p>
    <p class="card">The King is dead. The parade marches on.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="final">
    <h3>Scene End – Clues Unlocked</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Carmen survives</strong>.</li>
      <li>Joker used her to distract the team and execute his true plan.</li>
      <li>The metronome was a misdirect.</li>
      <li>On the chair is a final carving:
        <blockquote>“Your captain watched from the tower. He’ll watch again.”</blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>The “Tower” = Police HQ. The <strong>Captain is next</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
