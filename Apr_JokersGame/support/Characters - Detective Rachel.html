    <h1>Character - Detective Rachel</h1>
    <h2>Rachel Morales – The Forensic Perfectionist</h2>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Rachel Morales always knew she wanted to be in law enforcement, but she never envisioned herself chasing criminals with a gun in hand. Instead, she saw herself in the lab, meticulously analyzing fibers, blood spatter, and DNA. Science was her language, and <strong>forensics was her passion.</strong></p>
    
    <p>Raised in a working-class family, Rachel was the first in her family to go to college. She pursued <strong>biochemistry and forensic science</strong>, earning top honors. While interning at the police department’s forensic unit, she developed a reputation for <strong>noticing what others missed</strong>—a single hair, a microscopic tear in clothing, or an odd chemical compound. Her attention to detail led to multiple breakthroughs in cases, catching the eye of seasoned detectives.</p>
    
    <p>Despite preferring the lab over the streets, Rachel <strong>chose to become a detective</strong> rather than stay behind a microscope. She wanted to see investigations through from <strong>crime scene to conviction</strong>, ensuring that no mistakes were made in the pursuit of justice.</p>
    
    <h2>Personality & Approach</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Perfectionist & Methodical</strong> – Every detail matters. If it doesn’t fit, she won’t rest until she knows why.</li>
        <li><strong>Cautious & By-the-Book</strong> – She believes in procedure and hates taking unnecessary risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Logical & Analytical</strong> – She approaches cases like a puzzle, breaking them down piece by piece.</li>
        <li><strong>Empathetic but Detached</strong> – She cares about victims but doesn’t let emotions cloud her judgment.</li>
        <li><strong>Secretly Competitive</strong> – While she pretends she doesn’t care, she <strong>hates being wrong.</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Relationship with the Team</h2>
    <p><strong>Evelyn "Evie" Carter (Lead Detective):</strong> Rachel sees Evie as a role model. She admires her leadership but sometimes struggles with her gut-driven approach.</p>
    <p><strong>Samantha Vaughn (Rookie, Ex-Hacker):</strong> Their differences make them clash. Samantha rushes into things, while Rachel prefers a careful analysis. However, when they work together, they make an unstoppable team.</p>
    <p><strong>Captain Marcus Holloway:</strong> She respects his experience and values his approval. She often seeks his input when doubting herself.</p>
    
    <h2>How She Feels About the Joker Killer Case</h2>
    <p>To Rachel, this case is <strong>a test of precision.</strong> The Joker Killer isn’t just leaving riddles—he’s leaving <strong>forensic evidence woven into the puzzles.</strong> Every fiber, every bloodstain, every number has a <strong>pattern.</strong></p>
    
    <p>The challenge? <strong>Deciphering that pattern before more people die.</strong></p>
    
    <p>While Samantha sees the Joker Killer as a game to win, Rachel sees him as <strong>a mistake waiting to happen.</strong> No one is perfect. Not even a killer obsessed with logic. And when he makes that mistake, she’ll be the one to find it.</p>
