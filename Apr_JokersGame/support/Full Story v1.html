  <h1>Start of the Game – <em>Puzzle Craze</em></h1>

  <h2>Opening Scene: The First Move</h2>
  <p>It’s a quiet night at the precinct—until the phone rings.<br>
  A distorted voice delivers a chilling message:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “You’re looking in the wrong place. But if you want to find him, you’ll have to play by my rules.”
  </blockquote>
  <p><strong>Captain Marcus Holloway</strong> slams the receiver down.</p>
  <blockquote>“Gear up. We’ve got a tip-off.”</blockquote>

  <h2>📍 Location 1: The Anonymous Tip (Puzzle Set 1)</h2>
  <p>The detectives arrive at an apartment on the edge of the city.</p>
  <p>They were expecting a corpse. Instead, they find a room frozen in tension:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A <strong>shattered coffee table</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Deep scratch marks</strong> in the hardwood floor</li>
    <li>A <strong>single Joker playing card</strong>, pristine and deliberate, placed at the center</li>
  </ul>

  <p>As <strong>Evie Carter</strong> picks up the card, <strong>Lily</strong> mutters:</p>
  <blockquote>“Looks like someone’s playing games with us.”</blockquote>
  <p><strong>Rachel</strong> scans the room.</p>
  <blockquote>“No blood. No body. But definitely a struggle.”</blockquote>
  <p><strong>Samantha</strong> reveals a hidden code under UV light:</p>
  <blockquote><strong>Puzzle 1:</strong> “17 15 2 1 3 11 – 3 15 4 5” → <em>GO BACK CODE</em></blockquote>

  <p><strong>Puzzle 2:</strong> A Vigenère cipher using GO BACK →</p>
  <blockquote>“Next breath stolen on stage. The spotlight hides the scream.”</blockquote>

  <p><strong>Puzzle 3:</strong> USB decryption (audio + image of a spotlight). Reversed audio says:</p>
  <blockquote>“He told the truth. They silenced him. Now the curtains rise for another.”</blockquote>

  <p><strong>Puzzle 4:</strong> A watch frozen at <em>3:12 AM</em> matches timestamp on USB video.<br>
  Confirms the victim is <strong>Daniel Keller</strong>, an investigative journalist.</p>

  <p><strong>Puzzle 5:</strong> A spectrogram of the Joker’s voice reveals the location of the body: <em>Location 2</em>.</p>

  <h2>📍 Location 2: Finding the Body (Puzzle Set 2)</h2>
  <p>The detectives find Daniel’s body as predicted. Back at HQ, a digital crime scene report arrives.</p>
  <p><strong>Puzzle Set 2:</strong> Analyze evidence, patterns, and encrypted files. If solved in time, they can prevent another murder.</p>

  <h2>📍 Location 3: Clues to the Next Move</h2>
  <h3>Branch 1 – Puzzle Set 4:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Given 24 hours to solve a riddle</li>
    <li>Suspected location is staked out—turns out to be a red herring</li>
    <li>A new body is found at <strong>Location 4</strong></li>
    <li>The red herring itself contained a clue about the Joker</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Branch 2 – Puzzle Set 6:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Scene of failed rescue is analyzed</li>
    <li>Leads to <strong>Location 5</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📍 Location 4: The Joker’s Trap (Puzzle Set 5)</h2>
  <p>This was a misdirection in Branch 1. The Joker taunts them:</p>
  <blockquote>“While you waited, I played my next card. Better luck next time.”</blockquote>
  <p>He warns:</p>
  <blockquote>“I will increase the frequency and number of victims until I’m caught.”</blockquote>

  <h2>📍 Location 5: The Single Card (Puzzle Set 7)</h2>
  <p>Both branches converge here. A body and a single card.</p>
  <p>The Joker issues a final challenge:</p>
  <blockquote>“Now you choose. One team, or many minds?”</blockquote>
