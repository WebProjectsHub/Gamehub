    <h1>Captain Marcus Holloway – The Steadfast Leader</h1>
    
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Captain <strong>Marcus Holloway</strong> is a seasoned veteran of the force, known for his <strong>calm demeanor, sharp instincts, and no-nonsense approach to leadership</strong>. With over <strong>25 years of experience</strong>, he has seen it all—cold-blooded killers, corrupt officials, and cases that have haunted him for years. He believes in <strong>justice above all else</strong> but has learned the hard way that the system doesn’t always work in his favor.</p>
    
    <p>Once a brilliant <strong>homicide detective</strong>, Holloway worked some of the most brutal cases in the city’s history. He became captain after <strong>solving a high-profile serial killer case</strong>, but the victory came at a personal cost—his <strong>partner was killed in the final confrontation</strong>. That loss hardened him, making him both a mentor and a strict taskmaster.</p>
    
    <h2>Personality & Leadership Style</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Strategic & Calculated:</strong> Always looks at the <strong>big picture</strong>, ensuring that his detectives stay focused.</li>
        <li><strong>Respected, but Intimidating:</strong> He doesn’t tolerate <strong>recklessness</strong> but admires <strong>genuine talent</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Protective:</strong> Though he pushes his team hard, he sees them as <strong>his responsibility</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Skeptical of Technology:</strong> Prefers <strong>old-school detective work</strong>, often butting heads with Samantha Vaughn.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust Issues:</strong> Losing his partner left scars—he struggles to <strong>fully trust his team</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Relationship with the Detectives</h2>
    <p><strong>Evie Carter (Senior Detective):</strong> He <strong>trusts her judgment</strong> but pushes her to <strong>be more methodical</strong>.</p>
    <p class="quote">"Your instincts are good, Carter. Just don’t let them get you killed."</p>
    
    <p><strong>Samantha Vaughn (Rookie, Ex-Hacker):</strong> <strong>Disapproves of her unconventional methods</strong>, but secretly <strong>admires her resourcefulness</strong>.</p>
    <p class="quote">"This isn’t a damn video game, Vaughn. Every move you make has consequences."</p>
    
    <p><strong>Rachel Morales (Rookie, Forensic Expert):</strong> Respects her <strong>scientific mind</strong> but believes <strong>forensics alone won’t solve cases</strong>.</p>
    <p class="quote">"The evidence speaks, Morales. But make sure you’re asking the right questions."</p>
    
    <h2>How He Feels About the Joker Killer Case</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Frustrated</strong> that they are playing by the killer’s rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Worried</strong> that the younger detectives are being <strong>pulled too deep</strong> into the mind games.</li>
        <li><strong>Determined</strong> to <strong>end the killing spree</strong>, no matter what it takes.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Despite his hardened exterior, Captain Holloway <strong>cares deeply</strong> for his team and will do whatever it takes to keep them alive—even if it means <strong>breaking a few rules</strong>.</p>
