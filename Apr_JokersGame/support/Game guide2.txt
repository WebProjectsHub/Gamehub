Game Guide 2
The Scene
The rain had started in the early evening, thick, punishing sheets that lashed the windows of One Police Plaza with the rhythm of a metronome. The precinct, normally a fortress of activity and low rumble, stood silent and cold, cordoned off by police tape and floodlights. Outside, firetrucks idled, their engines growling low under the sound of the storm. Officers milled about behind hastily erected barricades, their radios spitting static, their orders clipped and uneasy.

Inside, the vast interior had been cleared. Offices stood abandoned, chairs still turned toward desks, computers blinking on standby. The station had been evacuated in under four minutes—a record, but not a victory.

Only one man remained: Captain Marcus Holloway, commanding officer, thirty-three years on the job. Decorated, feared, respected. And, as of 17:48 hours, trapped.

At 17:12, Holloway had taken a call routed directly to the precinct. The voice on the line was distorted—digitally filtered, a precaution. The voice asked for him by name. Told him to visit the evidence locker and retrieve a USB drive associated with a case long since closed.

He did as instructed. The file number was unfamiliar, but the name wasn’t: Eleanor Hayes. A civilian casualty in a botched raid, five years prior. An unfortunate footnote in departmental history—until now.

The USB was tucked between manila folders that hadn't been touched in years. No barcode. No chain-of-custody. It had no business being there.

He returned to his office, inserted the drive into his laptop. The screen flickered, once, then stabilized. A black window. White text.

“IF YOU STAND, YOU DIE.”

A digital timer materialized—60 minutes and counting.

Motion sensors, pressure triggers, and chemical sensors were installed in terrorist devices every year. Most were bluffs. This one wasn’t. Beneath his chair, hidden inside the base, was a small, custom explosive charge. Enough to liquefy his legs and ignite the ceiling tiles.

A sweep by the NYPD Bomb Squad confirmed it: there were no other explosives in the building. The threat to blow the rest of thbuilding had been theater—clever misdirection. The only real threat sat precisely beneath Holloway’s spine.

At 18:06, a message appeared on screen:

“CONFESS. TELL THEM WHO KILLED HER AND I WILL GIVE YOU THE DISARM CODE.”

The steady countdown continued, now accompanied by a 6-digit input box.  

The detectives arrived twenty minutes later.

They were ushered through a secure side entrance, badges scanned, faces grim. Four of them. Each had seen crime before—gruesome crime, cruel crime—but this was different. This wasn’t murder. This was theatre. A performance by an unseen puppeteer, with a very public message.

In the center of it all: the captain. Sweating in place, unmoving, as though made of glass.

He explained it briefly. No embellishment. The USB. The message. The demand: confess publicly, or die privately. The building had been cleared. Bomb techs had tried and failed to disarm the device. The Joker had anticipated them.

There was only one path forward.  Or so it seems.
