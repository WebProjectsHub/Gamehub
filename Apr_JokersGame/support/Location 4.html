  <h1>Location 4 – Abandoned Broadcast Station</h1>

  <p class="scene-desc">Setting: A long-defunct public radio station, WZRD 91.7. Crumbling walls, broken equipment, and a looming signal tower. The Joker Killer has lured the detectives here with a chilling message: <em>"Your captain watched from the tower. He’ll watch again."</em></p>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Exterior – WZRD Radio Station – Dusk</h2>
    <p>The detectives arrive in silence. Ivy coils up the brick facade. A raven flaps from the tower. The wind hums through the rusting vents.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">Evie:</p>
    <p>“This is where he wants us. The place is metaphor—broadcasting silence.”</p>

    <p class="dialogue">Lily:</p>
    <p>“Creepy. There’s something poetic about it... or maybe that’s what he wants us to think.”</p>

    <p class="dialogue">Rachel:</p>
    <p>“There are wires exposed near the side entrance—rigged recently. This place is supposed to be dead.”</p>

    <p class="dialogue">Samantha:</p>
    <p>“I’m picking up interference… like someone’s still transmitting from inside.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Interior – Recording Booths</h2>
    <p>Inside the control room, dust coats the consoles—except for one active microphone and a running cassette player. The static clears just enough to let a voice crawl through:</p>

    <blockquote>
      🎙️ "They called him a hero. They buried my truth in a broadcast no one aired. But tonight… the captain hears the final broadcast."
    </blockquote>

    <p>A red recording light flickers on. They're live.</p>

    <p class="dialogue">Evie:</p>
    <p>“We’re not just observers. This is the next performance.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="highlight">
    <h3>Evidence & Puzzle Clues</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>🕰️ A broken clock stuck at <strong>11:17</strong> — matches the cassette's timestamp.</li>
      <li>📄 A PSA script with bolded letters in blood-red ink — likely a cipher.</li>
      <li>📸 A photo board showing days of surveillance on the detectives.</li>
      <li>📅 A log with key dates marked. <strong>April 10</strong> is circled: <em>Tomorrow</em>.</li>
      <li>🧱 A chalkboard wall with the phrase:
        <blockquote>"The tower falls when no one listens."<br>"Voice lost in static."<br>"Truth jammed. Signal blocked. Silence achieved."</blockquote>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>The Stakeout</h2>
    <p>The speaker crackles again. A live voice. Not a recording.</p>

    <blockquote>
      🎙️ "You came to stop the silence. But the broadcast’s already been scheduled."
    </blockquote>

    <p class="dialogue">Samantha:</p>
    <p>“He's traced to a live transmitter—it's bouncing off police HQ's rooftop systems.”</p>

    <p class="dialogue">Evie:</p>
    <p>“He’s going after the Captain. During morning roll call.”</p>

    <p class="dialogue">Lily:</p>
    <p>“This wasn’t the crime scene. It was a dress rehearsal.”</p>
  </div>

  <div class="highlight">
    <h3>Hidden Compartment Discovery</h3>
    <p>Behind a false wall: wires, schematics of HQ's radio system, a transmitter shell… and a Joker card:</p>

    <p class="card">"All towers fall. Yours next."</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Scene End – Stakes Raised</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🧠 Joker Killer is infiltrating HQ systems remotely.</li>
      <li>📡 Scheduled broadcast: <strong>April 10, 7:00 AM</strong>.</li>
      <li>🎯 Target: <strong>The Captain</strong>.</li>
      <li>⌛ The detectives have less than <strong>12 hours</strong> to stop it.</li>
    </ul>
