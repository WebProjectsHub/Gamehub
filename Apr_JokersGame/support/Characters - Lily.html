    <h1>Character - Lily</h1>
    <h2>Lily Park – The Young, Brilliant Detective Trainee</h2>

    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Lily Park grew up in a family that loved brain teasers, crosswords, and mystery novels. While other kids were playing sports, she was solving cryptograms and escape room challenges. Her ability to spot patterns and think outside the box made her a standout in school, where she excelled in logic and deduction.</p>

    <p>Despite her analytical mind, Lily was never seen as a "traditional cop." Many in the academy doubted her, thinking she was too young, too eager, and too much of a "book nerd" to handle real police work. But what she lacked in field experience, she made up for in <strong>raw intelligence and unconventional thinking.</strong></p>

    <p>Her impressive test scores and quick reasoning caught the attention of higher-ups, and she was fast-tracked into detective training. Though she still has a lot to learn about working in the field, her sharp mind makes her an unexpected asset to the team.</p>

    <h2>Personality & Approach</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Eager & Enthusiastic</strong> – Always ready to dive into a case, sometimes too quickly.</li>
        <li><strong>Brilliant Problem-Solver</strong> – Sees connections others might overlook.</li>
        <li><strong>Unconventional Thinker</strong> – Thinks outside the box, sometimes breaking standard procedures.</li>
        <li><strong>Still Learning the Ropes</strong> – Inexperienced with real-world crime scenes and struggles with the emotional toll of the job.</li>
        <li><strong>Energetic & Optimistic</strong> – Despite the darkness of the cases, she believes every puzzle has a solution.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Relationship with the Team</h2>
    <p><strong>Evelyn "Evie" Carter (Lead Detective):</strong> Evie sees potential in Lily but is tough on her, knowing real-world detective work isn’t just about being smart—it’s about endurance.</p>
    <p><strong>Samantha Vaughn (Rookie, Ex-Hacker):</strong> They get along well, but Lily’s boundless energy sometimes clashes with Sam’s more cynical outlook.</p>
    <p><strong>Rachel Morales (Forensic Expert):</strong> Rachel respects Lily’s intellect but often reminds her that <em>"logic alone won’t solve everything—sometimes, you need evidence."</em></p>
    <p><strong>Captain Marcus Holloway:</strong> He wasn’t sure about assigning someone so young to the team, but he’s beginning to see why she was chosen.</p>

    <h2>How She Feels About the Joker Killer Case</h2>
    <p>To Lily, this case is <strong>the ultimate puzzle</strong>—a real-life challenge unlike anything she’s ever faced. The Joker Killer’s logic-based riddles excite and terrify her in equal measure. She wants to prove herself by solving them, but as the stakes rise, she starts to wonder: <strong>Is she just another piece in his game?</strong></p>

    <p>"Every puzzle has an answer… but what if this one was designed so we could never win?"</p>
