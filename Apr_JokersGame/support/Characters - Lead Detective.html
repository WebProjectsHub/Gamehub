    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Detective <strong>Evelyn "Evie" Carter</strong> is a seasoned investigator with <strong>over 12 years on the force</strong>. She is known for her <strong>sharp intuition</strong>, relentless work ethic, and ability to <strong>connect the dots</strong> where others see only chaos.</p>
    
    <p>Originally aspiring to be a <strong>criminal psychologist</strong>, Evie changed course after the tragic murder of a close friend. Fueled by a need for justice, she joined the police academy and quickly climbed the ranks, excelling in <strong>behavioral analysis, profiling, and interrogation tactics</strong>.</p>
    
    <h2>Personality & Approach</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Methodical but Intuitive:</strong> She follows the evidence but trusts her gut.</li>
        <li><strong>Deeply Empathetic:</strong> Cares deeply about victims and their families.</li>
        <li><strong>Determined to a Fault:</strong> Pushes herself beyond limits, often ignoring her own well-being.</li>
        <li><strong>Clashes with Superiors:</strong> Challenges red tape when it obstructs justice.</li>
        <li><strong>Despises Manipulative Killers:</strong> The Joker Killer's obsession with games makes this case personal.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Relationship with the Team</h2>
    <p><strong>Captain Marcus Holloway:</strong> Trusts her skills but warns her about recklessness. She respects his experience.</p>
    <p><strong>Samantha Vaughn (Rookie, Ex-Hacker):</strong> Sees potential but keeps a close watch on her impulsive nature.</p>
    <p><strong>Rachel Morales (Rookie, Forensic Expert):</strong> Balances Evie’s instincts with science and data-driven analysis.</p>
    
    <h2>How She Feels About the Joker Killer Case</h2>
    <p>Evie has faced dangerous killers before, but <strong>this one plays by different rules</strong>. The way the Joker Killer <strong>taunts law enforcement</strong> and <strong>turns murder into a game</strong> infuriates her.</p>
    
    <p>For Evie, solving this case isn’t just about stopping a killer—it’s about <strong>beating him at his own game</strong> before he escalates. But deep down, there’s a fear she won’t admit:</p>
