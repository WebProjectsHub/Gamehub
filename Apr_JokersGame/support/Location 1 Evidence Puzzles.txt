Perfect. Let’s start designing the first set of puzzles using the evidence from **Location 1**. The goal:  
- Reveal a **message from the Joker**,  
- Hint at the **next victim**, and  
- Uncover **what happened in the room**.

### 🔍 Puzzle Set 1: Location 1 Crime Scene

#### 🧩 Puzzle 1 – **The Playing Card Riddle**
**Item:** Joker Playing Card  
**Clue:** On the back is written:  
> _“Every story needs a twist.”_

But when held to UV light (Rachel's forensic kit), a **number sequence** appears:
```
7-15-2-1-3-15-4-5
```

**Solution:** Use A=1, B=2...  
> 7=G, 15=O, 2=B, 1=A, 3=C, 15=O, 4=D, 5=E  
→ **"GO BACK CODE"**

**Follow-Up:** This leads detectives to double-check the **torn notebook page** for a code.

#### 🧩 Puzzle 2 – **Notebook Grid Code**
**Item:** Torn Notebook Page  
**Description:** A grid of symbols with numbers scribbled in the corners. When cross-referenced with the message from the playing card, “GO BACK CODE,” it points to the corner with a faint grid cipher.

**Clue:** By aligning the numbers from the notebook grid and applying the code "GO BACK" as a key for a Vigenère cipher (Rachel recognizes the format), they decode:

> _"Next breath stolen on stage. The spotlight hides the scream."_  

**Reveals:**
- **Next victim** may be linked to **a theater** or performance space.

#### 🧩 Puzzle 3 – **USB Decryption Puzzle**
**Item:** USB Drive  
**Accessed by:** Samantha (ex-hacker)  
Encrypted file reveals **distorted audio log** and a **photo of a stage light**. The file name is “_Act2.Scene1_”.

**Audio Clip (scrambled, reversed):**
> “He told the truth. They silenced him. Now the curtains rise for another.”

**Clue to Solve:** Once reversed and cleaned, the audio reveals a potential motive — the victim was a **whistleblower or journalist**. The clue “curtains rise” reinforces the **theater** theme.

#### 🧩 Puzzle 4 – **Watch Time Match**
**Item:** Broken Watch (frozen at 3:12 AM, initials D.K.)  
**Clue:** The time matches a timestamp in the recovered USB file. Samantha correlates it with a frame from the photo — the victim is wearing the same watch.

**Reveal:** Confirms identity of the victim: **D.K. = Daniel Keller**, local investigative journalist.

#### 🧩 Puzzle 5 – **The Final Message**
**Item:** Joker’s Audio (motion sensor triggered)  
**Playback Analysis:** Lily notices there's a background hum behind the distorted voice — an **audio spectrogram reveals a hidden waveform pattern**.

The waveform, when mapped, reveals the letters:  
> **"CLUB NOIR"**

**Conclusion:**
- Joker’s next move will take place at a **venue called Club Noir** — possibly a theater or underground performance space.
- Daniel Keller was targeted because he was about to expose something — perhaps even the Joker himself.
- The Joker staged the scene to taunt the detectives and initiate his deadly game.
