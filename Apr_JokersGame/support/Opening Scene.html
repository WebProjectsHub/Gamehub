  <h1>Opening Scene: "The First Move"</h1>

  <h2>INT. POLICE STATION ‚Äì EARLY MORNING</h2>
  <p>The rain taps against the windows of the precinct. Detective <strong>Evelyn Carter</strong> sips her coffee, the weight of a long night lingering on her shoulders. A sudden flash on her monitor catches her attention ‚Äî an encrypted internal message, no sender, no trace.</p>

  <div class="quote">
    SUBJECT: ‚ÄúGame Start‚Äù<br>
    MESSAGE: ‚ÄúDetectives, the city is a board. The pieces are in place. You have 48 hours before someone dies. If you want to play‚Ä¶ go to 217 Wilcox Street. Bring your team.‚Äù<br>
    ‚Äî J
  </div>

  <p>Evie‚Äôs eyes narrow. She grips her coffee, her thoughts already racing.</p>

  <h2>CUT TO:</h2>
  <h3>INT. POLICE STATION ‚Äì BRIEFING ROOM</h3>
  <p>Evie assembles her team: <strong>Samantha Vaughn</strong>, <strong>Rachel Morales</strong>, and <strong>Lily</strong>. The atmosphere is tense.</p>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li><strong>Evie</strong>: "We‚Äôve got a situation. No caller. No voice. Just this."</li>
    <li><strong>Samantha</strong>: "Encrypted?"</li>
    <li><strong>Evie</strong>: "Military-grade. Whoever sent this knows how to cover their tracks."</li>
    <li><strong>Lily</strong> (grinning): "A challenge?"</li>
    <li><strong>Rachel</strong> (frowning): "Or a trap."</li>
  </ul>

  <p>They gear up quickly. No body, no immediate crime report‚Äîjust an address and a cryptic message.</p>

  <h2>EXT. 217 WILCOX STREET ‚Äì LATER THAT MORNING</h2>
  <p>The team arrives, expecting to find a victim. Instead, they enter an empty room. The space is unsettling, marked by signs of a violent struggle ‚Äî a shattered coffee table, deep scratch marks on the wooden floor, and in the center of it all, a single <strong>playing card</strong> laid out neatly.</p>

  <p>A motion sensor triggers. The projector on the far wall flickers to life.</p>
  <div class="quote">
    JOKER KILLER (distorted voice): "Thank you for playing. The clock is ticking. Let's see if you're clever enough to find the body‚Ä¶ before the smell does."
  </div>

  <h2>The Investigation Begins</h2>
  <h3>üîé Initial Observations:</h3>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li><strong>No body:</strong> Despite the message implying a murder, there‚Äôs no sign of anyone.</li>
    <li><strong>Signs of struggle:</strong> Broken furniture, overturned chairs, and drag marks suggest a violent struggle ‚Äî but where is the victim?</li>
    <li><strong>The Joker card:</strong> A chilling calling card. A signature left behind by the supposed killer? A clue deliberately placed?</li>
    <li><strong>No forced entry:</strong> Did the victim know their attacker?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>The Big Questions:</h3>
  <ul class="bullet">
    <li>Is the victim dead, or was he taken?</li>
    <li>What made him a target?</li>
    <li>Who left the card ‚Äî and why?</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Evie</strong> picks up the playing card. <strong>Riley</strong> mutters under her breath, ‚ÄúLooks like someone‚Äôs playing games with us.‚Äù</p>
  <p><strong>Sofia</strong> frowns, scanning the room. ‚ÄúThe question is‚Ä¶ are we chasing a ghost or a killer?‚Äù</p>

  <h2><em>The hunt begins.</em></h2>
