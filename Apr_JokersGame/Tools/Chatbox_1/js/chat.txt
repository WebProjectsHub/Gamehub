2. No one is born a monster. They are made.
3. You knew me once. You just didn't notice.
4. Chaos needs a face. I chose one fitting.
5. Names are masks. I burned mine long ago.
6. Your memory is as dusty as these archives.
7. It only matters when you scream it at the end.
8. Trust is a fragile thing. Easily shattered.
9. Because someone has to make you see.
10. The cracks beneath your perfect little world.
11. Revenge is just the beginning.
12. Injustice demands answers. I’m simply the echo.
13. Clocktower Library. Hurry. Time is ticking.
14. Patience. You will know soon enough.
15. Less than your nerves can handle.
16. Every bargain comes at a cost.
17. Hope is a sharp blade. Handle it carefully.
18. Your pride - Your certainty. Your fall.
19. Because you believe you’re untouchable.
20. Fame is for fools. I want the truth revealed.
21. Oh, it's very, very personal.
22. Save them? Solve me first.
23. The riddles, the lies, the little trails of blood.
24. Real? Reality bends in my playground.
25. Only if you're willing to bleed for it.
26. Because simply killing is too easy.
27. It's the only game that matters.
28. Tests reveal true character, - or lack of it.
29. Victory is just another shade of failure.

39. I want to see you crack. It’s so much more fun.
40. An ending is just another beginning. For me.
41. Destroying? No. I'm just testing your limits.
42. They think they’re above the law. Time to bring them down.
43. Blame is for those who think they have time. I don’t care for it.

*****46. Does it even matter, huh? I’m everywhere.
47. You think you can stop me? You can’t even catch up.

54. Caught? What’s the fun in being caught?
55. Clues make the game more interesting. But caught? Never.

116. Special? It’s the beginning. Not the end.
